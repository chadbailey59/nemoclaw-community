# NemoClaw Community Example Catalog

Examples are organized first by artifact type. Reusable recipes are organized
again by contributor provenance.

## NVIDIA Recipes

| Example | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Developer Community Chief of Staff](recipes/nvidia/developer-community-chief-of-staff/README.md) | Synthesizes Slack, Outlook, GitHub, and mirrored community signals into operating briefs, gaps, priorities, and follow-up recommendations. |
| [Payment Operations Hermes Assistant](recipes/nvidia/payment-ops-hermes/README.md) | Demonstrates constrained payment screening, evidence preparation, and a platform-enforced human release boundary. |

## Partner Recipes

| Tavily | [Watchtower](recipes/partners/tavily/watchtower/README.md) | Runs scheduled, cited web monitoring with persistent deduplication and auditable outputs. |

Future independent contributions without formal organizational provenance
belong under `recipes/community/`.

## Developer Tools

| Example | Description |

## Contributing An Example

Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) and the canonical
[example taxonomy and naming policy](../.agents/skills/nemoclaw-community-contributor-examples/references/example-taxonomy.md).
Examples must remain independently deployable and must document their
prerequisites, credentials, policies, startup behavior, verification, and
teardown behavior.
